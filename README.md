# mp3-split

Split audio (and video) files

## Install

Make sure you have [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) installed and added to your path then run:

```bash
npm install [-g] mp3-split
```

If you don't have ffmpeg installed, you can install [this package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ffmpeg-binaries) which 
comes with a bundled ffmpeg, and mp3-split will automatically detect and use it.

```bash
npm install [-g] ffmpeg-binaries
```

## CLI

mp3-split comes with a built in CLI tool. Type `mp3-split -h` to list all options and see an usage example.
For input you can use either a YouTube link or a local file.

The template file format should be in the following format.
For more info, checkout [ffmpeg's duration syntax](https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-utils.html#Time-duration) page.
```
[([hh:]mm:ss[.ms...])] My Music Name
```

A template file usually looks like this:
```
[00:00] eli filosov [ p h i l o ] - oneofone_rwrk
[01:30] Swishers [SwuM x bsd.u]
[03:28] sweetbn _ i held you so close i forgot the world
[05:52] emune - Gretchen
[07:52] jhfly - sheets
[10:00] arbour - elusive
[11:30] tomppabeats - will you stay here with me
[12:40] tomppabeats - lonely but not when you hold me
[13:31] Bassti - To All The Ladys In The Place
[15:37] wish you still felt this way [ sophie meiers x 90sFlav ]
[18:04] quickly, quickly - getsomerest/sleepwell
[23:36] charlie toÃ˜ human - that "just got home from work" type of beat.
[25:37] jinsang - affection
[27:32] jhfly - girl
```

## Library

You can also use mp3-split as a library. Ex:

```js
let mp3Split = require('mp3-split');
let options = {input: 'myaudio.mp3', audios: ['[01:30] My audio']};
let split = mp3Split(options);
split.parse().then((sections) => {
  for (let section of sections) {
    console.log(section.name);      // filename
    console.log(section.start);     // section start
    console.log(section.end);       // section end
    console.log(section.trackName); // track name
  }
});
```

mp3-split emits the following events.

```js
// emitted before splitting a file section
mp3Split.on('beforeSplit', (info) => console.log(info));
// emitted after splitting file
mp3Split.on('afterSplit', (parsedInfo) => console.log(parsedInfo));
// emitted when a video is found within the given url
mp3Split.on('url', (videoInfo) => console.log(videoInfo));
// emitted when the "sections" option is parsed and BEFORE splitting the file
mp3Split.on('data', (data) => console.log(data));
```
